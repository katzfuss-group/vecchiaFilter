Description: The main purpose of this package will instead be focused upon the 
    update function based on implementing all of these Vecchia functions to 
    calculate the EnKF update step. The package will also contain several other 
    update functions to compare these update steps with example graphical 
    representations of possible simulations. Finally, there will be an 
    implementation of a Lorenz Chaos Model to run numerical simulations of the 
    update functions.
