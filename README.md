# vecchiaFilter
code for Hierarchical sparse Cholesky decomposition with applications to high-dimensional spatio-temporal filtering (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16901). In order to reproduce simulations form the main paper use the instructions in each `simulations-*` folder and in the `data-application` folder. Note that each set of simulations might take several hours to generate results.
